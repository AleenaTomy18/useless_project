## Basic Details
### Team Name: Approach


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anu Antony - College of engineering attingal

### Project Description
RealBreath™ is a spoof web application that pretends to verify your reality using your breath and absurd questions. Combining the aesthetic of biometric verification with nonsense humor, it delivers a visually polished and technically functioning experience that does absolutely nothing useful — intentionally.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most verification systems use biometrics, AI, and forms to validate identity. But what if you used all of that effort… for nothing at all? This project satirizes tech overreach and over-design in the funniest way possible

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Build a fully interactive web application that:

Looks like it performs biometric breath analysis

Makes users think they’re being verified

Outputs a certificate full of fake data

Delivers high visual appeal and technical credibility

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML/CSS/JS	Frontend UI, animations
VS Code	Code editing & running
Browser	Chrome / Firefox / Edge (modern)
Live Server (optional)	VS Code extension to live preview

For Hardware:
- Computer / Laptop	✅ Yes
Microphone	❌ No (breath is faked)

### Implementation
For Software:1. Breath Analysis Simulation
A pulsing animated circle simulates analyzing breath

After a delay, a fake result is generated from a list

2. Absurd Verification Questions
User answers a series of bizarre questions like:

"What’s your favorite triangle?"

"Prove that you blink."

3. Certificate Generator
User enters their name
JS randomly generates:
Fake gender (e.g., “Quantum Fluid”)
Animal category (e.g., “Window-Slapping Sea Duck”)
Breath rating (e.g., “Slightly Toasted Marshmallow”)
Fully printable via window.print()
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realbreath.git


# Run
Option 1: Using VS Code + Live Server
Open folder in VS Code

Install Live Server extension

Right-click on index.html → "Open with Live Server"

Option 2: Without Live Server
Open the folder

Double-click index.html to run in your browser



### Project Documentation
For Software:RealBreath™ is a web-based parody application that mimics biometric verification by analyzing a user's breath (fake), asking absurd philosophical questions, and issuing a printable spoof certificate. While entirely non-functional from a real verification standpoint, it demonstrates UI/UX design, JavaScript logic, and interactive web development — all packaged in a humorous and visually appealing experience.`

This is a site for determing our breathing capacity.App recognizes your gender and gives a certificate including the review of breathing ,gender etc...
